Presentation

    OPAL is a Java 6 library that implements Global Platform 2.x card specification.

    Global Platform card specification, as described by Wikipedia is <"a secure, dynamic card and application management
    specification that defines card components, command sets, transaction sequences and interfaces that are
    hardware-neutral, operating system neutral, vendor-neutral and application independent">.

    OPAL is able to upload and manage JavaCard applet lifecyle on Javacard while dealing of the authentication of
    the user and encryption of the communication between the user and the card.

    OPAL is also able to manage different implementations of the specification via a pluggable interface.
